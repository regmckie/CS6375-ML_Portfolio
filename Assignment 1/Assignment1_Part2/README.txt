DESCRIPTION:
"In this part, you will code a neural network (NN) having at least one hidden
layers, besides the input and output layers. You are required to pre-process the
data and then run the processed data through your neural net."


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN:
You can compile and run this program through the IDE of your choosing. I developed 
this program through PyCharm, and it was able to compile and run there successfully.
Alternatively, you can also run it on the terminal. Simply go into the directory where
the project is located and run this command: "python .\Assignment1_Part2.py", or something
equivalent. This program takes in no parameters and only consists of one .py file, so it 
should be relatively simple to run.

Once you start running the program it will take several minutes to execute. To see
a sample of what the output should look like, see the report. 

NOTE: My program uses the numpy and pandas packages, so if you're going to run it 
through the terminal, make sure those packages are installed first.
