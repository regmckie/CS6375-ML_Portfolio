# CS 6375 (Machine Learning) Portfolio
This is Reg Gonzalez's portfolio for class CS 6375.001 (Machine Learning). This portfolio is for the Spring 2024 semester at the University of Texas at Dallas, taught by Anurag Nagar. 


### Assignment 1: Neural Networks
In this part, you will code a neural network (NN) having at least one hidden layer, besides the input and output layers. You are required to pre-process the data and then run the processed data through your neural net.

### Assignment 2: K-means Unsupervised Learning Algorithm
Twitter provides a service for posting short messages. In practice, many of the tweets are very similar to each other and can be clustered together. By clustering similar tweets together, we can generate a more concise and organized representation of the raw tweets, which will be very useful for many Twitter-based applications (e.g., truth discovery, trend analysis, search ranking, etc.). In this assignment, you will learn how to cluster tweets by utilizing Jaccard Distance metric and K-means clustering algorithm. 

The objectives are to: 
- Compute the similarity between tweets using the Jaccard Distance metric. 
- Cluster tweets using the K-means clustering algorithm.

### Project
The project has two key components to it: (1) Understanding a recent machine learning technique and associated algorithm(s) and (2) Apply it to a standard dataset of sufficient complexity. You have to code
the main part of the algorithm without using any built-in library. You can use libraries for pre-processing, loading, analysis of results, etc.

For this project, I decided to code the KNN, logistic regression, and decision tree machine learning algorithms in order to predict the race of randomly generated DnD characters. More details are provided in the "Project" folder where you can read the project's own README.
