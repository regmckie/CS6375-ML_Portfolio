# FILENAME: DecisionTrees.py
# DUE DATE: 5/5/2024
# AUTHOR:   Reg Gonzalez
# EMAIL:    rdg170330@utdallas.edu (school) or regmckie@gmail.com (personal)
# COURSE:   CS 6375.001, Spring 2024
# VERSION:  1.0
#
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
# The project is an essential part of this class. It will allow you to demonstrate
# your Machine Learning (ML) skills and create something that you are proud of.
# It can also be a valuable addition to your projects portfolio that you can
# demonstrate to prospective employers.
#
# The project has two key components to it:
# - Understanding a recent machine learning technique and associated
# algorithm(s)
# - Apply it to a standard dataset of sufficient complexity. You have to code
# the main part of the algorithm without using any built-in library. You can
# use libraries for pre-processing, loading, analysis of results, etc.
#
# FILE DESCRIPTION:
# This file contains the code for the Decision Trees algorithm from scratch.
# This will help train the Decision Tree model and compare it to other
# kinds of models.
