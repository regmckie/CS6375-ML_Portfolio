COURSE:   CS 6375.001, Spring 2024

DESCRIPTION:
"The project is an essential part of this class. It will allow you to demonstrate
your Machine Learning (ML) skills and create something that you are proud of.
It can also be a valuable addition to your projects portfolio that you can
demonstrate to prospective employers.

The project has two key components to it:
- Understanding a recent machine learning technique and associated algorithm(s)
- Apply it to a standard dataset of sufficient complexity. You have to code
the main part of the algorithm without using any built-in library. You can
use libraries for pre-processing, loading, analysis of results, etc.


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN:
You can compile and run this program through the IDE of your choosing. I developed 
this program through PyCharm, and it was able to compile and run there successfully.
Alternatively, you can also run it on the terminal. Simply go into the directory where
the project is located and run this command: "python .\main.py", or something
equivalent. Even though this project has multiple files, the LogisticRegression.py, kNN.py,
and DecisionTrees.py files don't get explicitly called by the user. They're simply imported
into the main.py file, so this could should be relatively simple to run.

Once you start running the program it will take a while to execute, especially if you're executing
it for the first time. So please be patient. To see a sample of what the output should look like,
see the document named "CS 6375 Report - Results". 


DATASET USED:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewabeles/dnd-stats?select=stats.csv

I've included the dataset as part of the project submission in case you may need it; however,
I did host the dataset through a public Github repository. In my code, I'm getting the dataset
from that repository and not from within the project folder's directory.
