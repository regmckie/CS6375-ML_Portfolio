DESCRIPTION:
"Twitter provides a service for posting short messages. In practice, many of the tweets are very
similar to each other and can be clustered together. By clustering similar tweets together, we can
generate a more concise and organized representation of the raw tweets, which will be very
useful for many Twitter-based applications (e.g., truth discovery, trend analysis, search ranking,
etc.).

In this assignment, you will learn how to cluster tweets by utilizing Jaccard Distance metric and
K-means clustering algorithm.

The objectives are to:
Compute the similarity between tweets using the Jaccard Distance metric.
Cluster tweets using the K-means clustering algorithm."


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN:
You can compile and run this program through the IDE of your choosing. I developed 
this program through PyCharm, and it was able to compile and run there successfully.
Alternatively, you can also run it on the terminal. Simply go into the directory where
the project is located and run this command: "python .\Assignment2_Part2.py", or something
equivalent. This program takes in no parameters and only consists of one .py file, so it 
should be relatively simple to run.

Once you start running the program it will take several minutes to execute. To see
a sample of what the output should look like, see the report.
